    Ed W contributed some more functionality and renamed some options and methods to make things a bit more sane. 

    *NOTE*: The following options and methods have been deprecated:
        -   The 'lazy' config option is now called 'autoload_user'
        -   The 'user' helper is now called 'current_user'
        -   The 'user_exists' helper is now called 'is_user_authenticated'

    Using these options and helpers will now generate deprecation warnings; they will be removed in the next release.

    Ivo Welch was kind enough to send me his first ever Mojolicious application that demonstrates the usage of this module, and I've included it in the distribution.
    Changed the date on copyright notices to 2012 - how time flies! 

1.20      2011-12-15 15:00:24 Asia/Jakarta
    Added "lazy_mode" and "signature_exists" along with some doc patches (meettya) 

1.19      2011-09-25 21:26:38 Asia/Jakarta
    Added an 'extra_data' hashref to the authenticate method that will be passed to your registered callback, 
    and merged in some documentation fixes courtesy of metaperl. 

1.18      2011-07-27 01:15:43 Asia/Jakarta
    Fixed a bug for newer versions of Mojolicious that no longer send the same set of parameters to a hook
    Added the ability to pass extra data to the validate_user callback, it came up as a need in a project so ported it over

1.16      2011-06-04 18:29:01 Asia/Jakarta
    POD fixes and cleanup

1.15      2011-05-02 02:32:12 Asia/Jakarta
    Added a README.pod file for Github to display, since the "real" README is generated by Dist::Zilla

1.14      2011-04-30 00:39:11 Asia/Jakarta
    Code cleanup (memowe) 

1.13      2011-04-25 17:49:13 Asia/Jakarta
    Added extra check on load_user and validate_user configuration options to make sure they're not only there,
        but they are actually code refs

1.12      2011-04-25 16:00:21 Asia/Jakarta
    A little bit of code cleanup, no major changes
