=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication - A plugin to make authentication a bit easier

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication

    $self->plugin('authentication' => {
        'autoload_user' => 1,
        'session_key' => 'wickedapp',
        'load_user' => sub { ... },
        'validate_user' => sub { ... },
        'current_user_fn' => 'user', # compatibility with old code
    });

    if ($self->authenticate('username', 'password', { optional => 'extra data stuff' })) {
        ... 
    }


=head1 METHODS

=head2 authenticate($username, $password, $extra_data_hashref)

Authenticate will use the supplied C<load_user> and C<validate_user> subroutine refs to see whether a user exists with the given username and password, and will set up the session accordingly.  Returns true when the user has been successfully authenticated, false otherwise. You can pass additional data along in the extra_data hashref, it will be passed to your C<validate_user> subroutine as-is.

=head2 is_user_authenticated

Returns true if current_user() returns some valid object, false otherwise.

=head2 current_user

Returns the user object as it was returned from the supplied C<load_user> subroutine ref.

=head2 reload_user

Flushes the current user object and then returns user().

=head2 signature_exists

Returns true if uid signature exist on the client side (in cookies), false otherwise.

Warning: non-secure check! Use this method only for a "fast & dirty"  lookup to see if the client has the proper cookies. May be helpful in some cases (for example - in counting 'guest'/'logged users' or for additional non-confidential information for 'logged users' but not for 'guest').

=head2 logout

Removes the session data for authentication, and effectively logs a user out.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following options can be set for the plugin:

=over 4

=item load_user (REQUIRED) A coderef for user loading (see L</"USER LOADING">)

=item validate_user (REQUIRED) A coderef for user validation (see L</"USER VALIDATION">)

=item session_key (optional) The name of the session key

=item autoload_user (optional) Turn on/off automatic loading of user data - user data can be loaded only if it be used. May reduce site latency in some cases.

=item current_user_fn (optional) Set the name for the current_user() helper function

=back 

In order to set the session expiry time, use the following in your startup routine:

    $app->plugin('authentication', { ... });
    $app->sessions->default_expiration(86400); # set expiry to 1 day
    $app->sessions->default_expiration(3600); # set expiry to 1 hour

=head1 USER LOADING

The coderef you pass to the load_user configuration key has the following signature:

    sub { 
        my ($app, $uid) = @_;
        ...
        return $user;
    }

The uid is the value that was originally returned from the C<validate_user> coderef. You must return either a user object (it can be a hashref, arrayref, or a blessed object) or undef.

=head1 USER VALIDATION

User validation is what happens when we need to authenticate someone. The coderef you pass to the C<validate_user> configuration key has the following signature:

    sub {
        my ($app, $username, $password, $extradata) = @_;
        ...
        return $uid;
    }

You must return either a user id or undef. The user id can be numerical or a string. Do not return hashrefs, arrayrefs or objects, since the behaviour of this plugin could get a little bit on the odd side of weird if you do that. 

=head1 EXAMPLES

For a code example using this, see the F<t/01-functional.t> and F<t/02-functional_lazy.t> tests, it uses L<Mojolicious::Lite> and this plugin.

=head1 ROUTING VIA CONDITION

This plugin also exports a routing condition you can use in order to limit access to certain documents to only authenticated users.

    $r->route('/foo')->over(authenticated => 1)->to('mycontroller#foo');

    my $authenticated_only = $r->route('/members')->over(authenticated => 1)->to('members#index');
    $authenticated_only->route('online')->to('members#online');

If someone is not authenticated, these routes will not be considered by the dispatcher and unless you have set up a catch-all route, a 404 Not Found will be generated instead. 

And another condition for fast and unsecured checking for users, having a signature (without validating it). This method just checks client cookies for uid data existing.

    $r->route('/foo')->over(signed => 1)->to('mycontroller#foo');

This behavior is similar to the "authenticated" condition.

=head1 ROUTING VIA CALLBACK

If you want to be able to send people to a login page, you will have to use the following:

    my $members_only = $r->route('/members')->to(cb => sub {
        my $self = shift;

        $self->redirect_to('/login') and return 0 unless($self->is_user_authenticated);
        return 1;
    });

    $members_only->route('online')->to('members#online');

Lazy and unsecured methods:

    my $members_only = $r->route('/unimportant')->to(cb => sub {
        my $self = shift;

        $self->redirect_to('/login') and return 0 unless($self->signature_exists);
        return 1;
    });

    $members_only->route('pages')->to('unimportant#pages');

=head1 ROUTING VIA BRIDGE

If you want to be able to send people to a login page, you will have to use the following:

    my $auth_bridge = $r->bridge('/members')->to('auth#check');
    $auth_bridge->route('/list')->to('members#list'); # only visible to logged in users

And in your Auth controller you would put:

    sub check {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->redirect_to('/login') and return 0 unless($self->is_user_authenticated);
        return 1;
    });

Lazy and unsecured methods:

    sub check {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->redirect_to('/login') and return 0 unless($self->signature_exists);
        return 1;
    });
